Abstract = {{Water distribution networks are critical infrastructures that should
   ensure the reliable supply of high quality potable water to its users.
   Numerical models of these networks are generally governed by many
   parameters for which the exact value is not known. This may be due to a
   lack of precise knowledge like for consumer demand or due to a lack of
   accessibility as for the pipe roughness. For network managers, the
   effect of these uncertainties on the network state is important
   information that supports them in the decision-making process. This
   effect is generally evaluated by propagating the uncertainties using the
   mathematical model. In the past, perturbation, fuzzy and stochastic
   collocation methods have been used for uncertainty propagation. However,
   these methods are limited either in the accuracy of the results or the
   computational effort of the necessary calculations. This paper uses an
   alternative spectral approach that uses the polynomial chaos expansion
   and has the potential to give results of comparable accuracy to the
   Monte Carlo sampling through the definition of a stochastic model. This
   approach is applied to the hydraulic model of two real networks in order
   to evaluate the influence of uncertain demands on the water age.}},

Abstract = {{In Ireland the political consensus to expand forest cover has not been
   really questioned for the last five decades, neither by policy-makers
   nor by forest owners' representatives. However, in 2014, Irish private
   forest owners experienced for the first time in their life a
   catastrophic windstorm. A qualitative survey, conducted among the forest
   owners affected by the storm, shows that beyond the economic losses this
   disaster deeply shook their convictions about the real benefits of
   afforestation programmes. Using the theoretical concept of relational
   expectations, we show that Storm Darwin deconstructed a significant part
   of their identity as their status switched from audacious pioneer to
   forestry loser overnight. The political and socio-economic structures
   outweighed the agency of individuals and their initial desire not to
   reforest. While the reconstitution scheme gave them the direction to
   follow, it reduced the risk of desertion. However, our study also shows
   that landowners may be a lot more cautious before signing up for
   afforestation programmes in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Global private sustainability standards in agriculture today govern a
   range of commodities produced in the tropics. Our study analyses the
   most well-established of these standards, namely the Roundtable on
   Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). We show how, far from being a market device
   restricted to re-organising global markets in palm oil, RSPO
   standardisation has wider consequences spatially re-distributing power
   with territorial effects. Territorialisation occurs through two
   processes: a strategic and operational process linked to the fabrication
   and application of procedural rules; a socio-technological process
   linked to the valorisation of managerial approaches to sustainability.
   Over time, these twin processes have institutionalised a transnational
   political space of action with territorial properties. These include:
   new frontiers of political authority de-bordering national jurisdiction
   (geographically connecting local scale oil palm estates and plantations
   with a transversal global supply chain stretching from producing to
   consuming countries); historical connection; internal coherence and
   imposition of managerial practices and discourses, including managerial
   constructions of interdependencies between people, nature and artefacts;
   prime beneficiaries (large southeast Asian growers, international
   environmental NGOs and (mainly) European downstream firms); marginalised
   people (independent smallholders and communities in Malaysia and
   Indonesia). In this manner, RSPO reinforces its political power and
   authority over a managerial form of sustainability of palm oil
   production through territorialising it. Ultimately, this transnational
   political space of action comes into interaction (and, potentially,
   conflict) with other political spaces of action and territorial projects
   as pursued by local people, other NGOs or Malaysian and Indonesian state
   governments.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes transmission system operator (TSO)-host community

   three negotiation protocols (sequential, bilateral, and multilateral) as
   an alternative to the non-cooperative situation. We show that when the
   number of municipalities involved in the process is higher than 5, the
   multilateral bargaining procedure is the most profitable for all agents,
   including the municipalities. Inversely, when the number of

Month = {{APR 30}},
Abstract = {{This article presents the fourth version of the conceptual framework
   used in the ``IDEA{''} method (Indicateurs de durabilite des
   exploitations agricoles or Farm Sustainability Indicators) (IDEAv4). It
   combines two approaches: one based on sustainable agriculture goals and
   the other applying a systemic approach focusing on the properties of
   sustainable agricultural systems. The IDEAv4 method includes both strong
   sustainability and agricultural multifunctionality paradigms. It takes
   into account the global challenges of sustainable agriculture. Using
   this framework, we were able to develop 53 indicators to assess the
   sustainability of a given farm using two complementary approaches. The
   first approach assesses sustainability by dividing these 53 indicators
   into 13 components, according to the 3 normative dimensions of
   sustainable development (agroecological, socio-territorial, economic).
   This assessment process is based on a scoring system using 100 units for
   each dimension. There is no compensation between the scores of the three
   dimensions. The second approach assesses the level of sustainability
   based on 5 properties of sustainable agricultural systems (autonomy,
   robustness, ability to produce and reproduce goods and services,
   territorial embeddedness and overall responsibility), using a tree
   structure. This second approach is divided into 15 constituent branches
   of the 5 properties. The 53 indicators are aggregated with a qualitative
   and hierarchical approach, using the DEXi tool. This concept can be used
   for education, through a transdisciplinary teaching process. Following
   on from its three previous versions, IDEAv4 can also be used as a tool
   to support the process of agroecological transition.}},

Abstract = {{Modern water distribution networks (WDNs) are complex and difficult to

   of the management problems and essential mathematical models that are
   used to address these problems at various phases of WDNs. In addition,
   it also discusses the main approaches to address these management
   problems to meet customer demands at the required pressure in terms of
   adequate water quantity and quality. Key challenges that are associated

Abstract = {{The increasing number of coastal floods in recent years in France has
   resulted in the design of new adaptation principles for the most
   endangered coastal areas. The aim of the government is to reduce the
   vulnerability of these areas by relocating property and infrastructure.
   These measures have, however, come up against considerable opposition
   from the population concerned. Using a survey of 421 inhabitants of
   Hyeres, a coastal town in the South of France, this article proposes the
   study of resistance to relocation through the creation of an index for
   resistance that incorporates attachment to place, residential mobility
   and risk perception. The results show a correlation for the index and
   distance from the sea that highlights the existence of conflicting
   interests with adaptation measures depending upon population categories.
   Key policy insights In France, although coastal flooding risk is a key
   issue in numerous populated coastal areas, coastal dwellers show little
   willingness to relocate. Resistance to relocation can be assessed
   through a composite index integrating place attachment, residential
   mobility and risk perception. Application of such an index shows a
   correlation between willingness to relocate and distance from the sea.
   Conflicts of interest with adaptation measures also depend on the age of
   the dwellers, their standard of living and on home ownership.}},

Abstract = {{This study analyses the linkages between private forest owners'
   perceptions of forest management, and their affinity for subsidies, in a
   range of European countries. Society increasingly requires the provision
   of ecosystem services from forests, but the willingness of forest owners
   to redirect management goals from wood production to the provision of
   public goods is crucial for sustaining ecosystem services. EU incentives
   in the forestry sector are still mainly oriented towards an
   anthropocentric vision of forest management. Forest owners and managers
   are diverse, and although many efforts have been made to understand the
   role of forest subsidies in private forest management, it is still
   necessary to analyse the different perspectives on forest subsidies with
   a regional comparative approach. This paper explores European private
   forest owners' affinity for subsidies - through survey data at European
   level-and estimates an ordered probit model to (i) analyse how private
   forest owners in Europe respond to subsidies in forestry, including
   regional differences in terms of affinity for subsidies, (ii)
   characterize the factors that influence these responses and (iii)
   discuss lessons learned related to forest owners' attitudes on subsidies
   and the implications for introducing similar kind of incentives such as
   payments for ecosystem services. Simulations were conducted to examine
   the potential effects of changes in property fragmentation or the time
   allotted to forest activities. Forest owners with an utilitarian view of
   forest management, bigger forest holdings, full or part-time farmers and
   forest owners from East Europe are most in favour of forest subsidies.
   Property fragmentation and absenteeism decreases affinity for subsidies.}},

Abstract = {{This article analyzes the variety of governance arrangements in the

   government to governance into perspective as well as the extent to which
   new forestry discourses are being put into practice. The article
   concludes that recent (gradual) changes in governance arrangements in

Abstract = {{The historical record of the definition of forest management and policy

   This paper is an empirical and analytical contribution to the
   understanding of the political and socio-economic factors influencing
   the integration of stakes in forest-dominated landscapes. Based on a
   case study of the `Landes de Gascogne' forest region (southwestern
   France), it explores an apparent paradox that sees local landowners,
   following a massive storm damage, re-afforesting a Pinus pinaster
   plantation on a technical basis they know to be vulnerable. The authors
   highlight how, on which basis and by whom discourses and practices on
   forest integration have been sustained over decades in `Landes', albeit
   being in fact reinvented on very different grounds in a setting similar
   to the famous quote of the novel II Gattopardo. The idea of a forest
   massif is identified as the object of most efforts, enabling the
   strategical use of three entwined perspectives: as a cultivated forest,
   a multifunctional land-use and an integrated chain. Ending with an
   analysis of the interplays of these dimensions, the paper further
   demonstrates the relevance of landscape and relational approaches to
   grasp the determinants of forest land-use conflicts. (C) 2016 Elsevier

   knowledge, and social norms). Instead of identifying a profusion of very
   accurate profiles often too specific to a regional or national context,
   we also aim at attempting a generalization of ``forest owners
   meta-profiles{''}. Finally we distinguish five ones: ``optimizers or
   economy-oriented{''}, ``satisfiers or traditional knowledge
   oriented{''}, ``passive or outsider{''}, ``environmentally-oriented{''},
   and ``multifunctional public forest managers{''} Following this
   classification, we analysed the influence of structural factors such as
   public policies, market, environmental issues, knowledge, and social
   norms on decision making. Beyond this typology, we also identify some
   major trends in forest owners' attitudes: firstly, we show that forest
   owners adopt more easily forest policies which support the management
   activities that they have planned. They also may reshape those who do
   not fit with their goals. Although forest owners are not particularly in
   favour of the coercive power of the state, they appreciate this
   political authority as it create a legitimate arbiter and mediator for
   formal and negotiated agreements. Secondly, if the logic of utilitarism
   and factors as wood market are still important drivers for action, the
   respect of social norms (such as protecting the environment or managing
   the forest for public goods) gives less-profit-oriented forest owners a
   new legitimacy for action that did not exist 20 years ago. Finally, we
   also raise questions about the emergence of new forest owners who may
   reconsider their roles, and redefine forestry norms in the future
   instead of just following the rules. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a Ward- like hierarchical clustering algorithm

   D0 and D1 are inputted, along with a mixing parameter a. {[} 0, 1]. The
   dissimilarities can be nonEuclidean and the weights of the observations
   can be non- uniform. The first matrix gives the dissimilarities in the
   `` feature space{''} and the second matrix gives the dissimilarities in
   the `` constraint space{''}. The criterion minimized at each stage is a
   convex combination of the homogeneity criterion calculated with D0 and
   the homogeneity criterion calculated with D1. The idea is then to
   determine a value of a which increases the spatial contiguity without
   deteriorating too much the quality of the solution based on the

Abstract = {{This article proposes an innovative approach to assess the benefits of
   adapting to sea level rise (SLR) in a coastal area on a regional scale.
   The valuation framework integrates coastal ecosystem services, together

   progressive 1 m rise in sea level in the twenty-first century and an
   extreme flooding event in 2100 for four contrasted adaptation scenarios
   (Denial, ``Laissez-faire{''}, Protection and Retreat). The assessment
   involves coupling the results of hazard-modelling approaches with
   different economic valuation methods, including direct damage functions
   and methods used in environmental economics. The framework is applied to
   the French Mediterranean sandy coastline. SLR will result in major
   land-use changes at the 2100 time horizon: relocation or densification
   of urban areas, loss of agricultural land, increase in lagoon areas and
   modification of wetlands (losses, migration or extension of ecosystems).
   Total benefits of public adaptation options planned in advance could
   reach (sic)31.2 billion for the period 2010-2100, i.e. (sic)69,000 per

   to ensure that public services and coastal managers can anticipate the
   consequences of SLR and (ii) incorporating coastal ecosystems into the
   assessment of the adaptation options. Our findings could provide a basis

Abstract = {{River quality trajectories are presented for (i) organic pollution, (ii)
   eutrophication, (iii) nitrate pollution, and (iv) metal contamination
   over the Longue Dur,e (130 to 70 years). They are defined by a
   quantified state indicator (S) specific to each issue, compared to
   drivers (D) or pressures (P) and to social responses (R) that reflect
   the complex interactions between society and river quality. The Lower
   Seine River, naturally sensitive to anthropogenic pressures, greatly
   impacted by Paris urban growth, industrialization, and intensive
   agriculture, and well documented by the PIREN-Seine 25-year research
   program, was chosen to illustrate these trajectories. State indicators,
   dissolved oxygen, algal pigments, nitrate, and heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Hg,
   Pb, Zn) in sediments have only been monitored by river basin authorities
   since 1971. Therefore, their past changes have been reconstructed using
   three approaches: (i) reassessment of historical sources, (ii)
   pressure-state models that reconstruct past water quality, and (iii)
   sedimentary archives of past persistent contamination from dated
   floodplain cores. The indicators were then transformed into river
   quality status using contemporary water quality criteria throughout
   these records. Each environmental issue shows specific trajectories
   because each has its own relationship between the issue evidence and the
   social response, but all are characterized by very poor quality in the
   past, largely ignored: the long-term summer hypoxia (< 1880-1995), the
   summer eutrophication peak (1965-2005), the growing nitrate level since
   the 1950s, recently stabilized but still high, and the extreme metal
   contamination (> 1935-2000) that peaked in the 1960s. The efficiency of
   social responses has been highly variable but more efficient in the last
   15-25 years.}},

Abstract = {{Private forests are widespread in Europe providing a range of ecosystem
   services of significant value to society, and there are calls for novel
   policies to enhance their provision and to face the challenges of
   environmental changes. Such policies need to acknowledge the importance
   of private forests, and importantly they need to be based on a deep
   understanding of how property rights held by private forest owners vary
   across Europe. We collected and analysed data on the content of property
   rights based on formal legal requirements existing in 31 European
   jurisdictions. To allow a comparison across jurisdictions, we
   constructed an original Property Rights Index for Forestry encompassing
   five rights domains (access, withdrawal, management, exclusion and
   alienation). We documented substantial variation of the private forest
   owners' rights, and notably to i) make decisions in operational
   management and the formulation of management goals, ii) withdraw timber
   resources from their forest, and iii) exclude others from the use of
   forest resources. We identified broad relations between the scope for
   decision making of private forest owners and jurisdictions' former
   socio-political background and geographical distribution. The variation
   in the content of property rights has implications for the
   implementation of international environmental policies, and stresses the
   need for tailored policy instruments, when addressing European society's
   rural development, the bioeconomy, climate change mitigation measures
   and nature protection strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Uncertainty surrounding climate change has encouraged policy makers to
   engage in flexible and exploratory policies and forms of policy making.
   The article examines the potential of experimentation in devising
   coastal adaptation policies, taking into account its political
   dimensions. We analysed a multi-level experiment, funded by the French
   Ministry for the Environment from 2012 to 2015, where coastal
   municipalities volunteered to simulate the implementation of planned
   retreat as an adaptation strategy. Using insights from discursive
   institutionalism, we tracked developments throughout the experiment
   period. We highlight a combined process of governance experiment,
   allowing social innovation at local and regional scales, and a more
   strategic tool for the state, governing and steering local coastal
   policy with new instruments. We shed light on a particular policy
   entrepreneur (a public organization dealing with coastal management)
   playing at the intersection of these two forms, and in the interplay of
   policy scales. Although the experiment contributed to the innovation of
   legal and economic instruments and produced policy feedbacks in local
   planning and governance, learning capacities of the multi-scale
   architecture are still moderate to make planned retreat a reality in the
   near future. The conclusion considers performative and interpretive
   effects of policy experiments as further research questions to explore.}},

Abstract = {{The overarching aim of this review paper is to investigate the
   involvement of experts, citizens, and participatory professionals in
   forest policy decision-making processes. Three interpretations of
   governance are distinguished to translate the idea of an orchestra to
   European (forest) policy making processes, referring to Frank Fischer's
   differentiation between a centralised state guided by administrative and
   policy experts on the one hand and deliberative governance driven by
   citizen participation on the other and a form of governance by
   participation professionals. The review included in total 81 research
   articles published between 1998 and 2015 addressing participation and
   expert involvement in forest policy. The results show that governance by
   participatory professionals is clearly visible in forest policy making
   processes in Europe mainly involving traditional groups as forest
   owners. Whether these participation professionals are engaged in a
   deliberative process with citizens remains unanswered. The results
   furthermore show a strong involvement of experts though the literature
   is rather silent as to how this steering of experts evolves in
   participatory forest processes. Finally the analysis shows that
   governance by citizen participation is rather neglected in forest policy
   processes in Europe. It is perceived as difficult to pursue, even at the
   local level. Therefore this article found nearly no empirical evidence
   for a so-called citizen's orchestra with the competence to self-align by
   deliberation. Instead citizens seem to be no part of the orchestra
   itself, but remain outside as part of the audience.}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystem fragmentation is a serious threat to biodiversity and one of
   the main challenges in ecosystem restoration. River continuity
   restoration (RCR) has often targeted diadromous fishes, a group of
   species supporting strong cultural and economic values and especially
   sensitive to river fragmentation. Yet it has frequently produced mixed
   results and diadromous fishes remain at very low levels of abundance.
   Against this background, this paper presents the main challenges for
   defining, evaluating and achieving effective RCR. We first identify
   challenges specific to disciplines. In ecology, there is a need to
   develop quantitative and mechanistic models to support decision making,
   accounting for both direct and indirect impacts of river obstacles and
   working at the river catchment scale. In a context of dwindling
   abundances and reduced market value, cultural services provided by
   diadromous fishes are becoming increasingly prominent. Methods for
   carrying out economic quantification of non-market values of diadromous
   fishes become ever more urgent. Given current challenges for rivers to
   meet all needs sustainably, conflicts arise over the legitimate use of
   water resources for human purposes. Concepts and methods from political
   science and geography are needed to develop understandings on how the
   political work of public authorities and stakeholders can influence the
   legitimacy of restoration projects. Finally, the most exciting challenge
   is to combine disciplinary outcomes to achieve a multidisciplinary
   approach to RCR. Accordingly, the co-construction of intermediary
   objects and diagrams of flows of knowledge among disciplines can be
   first steps towards new frameworks supporting restoration design and
   planning.}},

Abstract = {{Water scarcity is a harsh reality for many regions. As a result,
   reducing losses from water supply systems (WSSs) is of great
   environmental importance around the world. In France, water suppliers
   are legally bound to reduce losses from their WSSs through loss
   reduction action plans (LRAPs). For these plans to work, they need to
   suit the area to which they are applied. Their impacts on water bodies
   (WBs) and the environment also need to be taken into account. This paper
   explains an innovative approach to fulfil these objectives. It involves
   adding two elements to the design of LRAPs: calculation of a water
   abstraction and discharge balance (WADB) and analysis of environmental
   effects (AEE) relating to loss reduction actions, based on life cycle
   assessment. The usefulness and the practicality of this approach are
   examined through two practical case studies. It is shown that the WADB
   allows LRAPs to be configured to optimise water savings in the most
   sensitive WBs. AEE makes it possible to identify a loss reduction level
   above which the overall environmental balance becomes negative. While
   the LRAP design and the WADB calculation methods are ready to be used by
   WSS managers, the AEE still requires further improvement.}},

   framework develops a transaction cost explanation for the extent to
   which participatory procedures help stakeholders to identify partners
   and initiate collaboration, and for the causal link between the
   attributes of these stakeholders and their partnerships. The p2 model is
   implemented to investigate partnership networks of the key actors that
   govern the management of the Gironde estuary, the study case. The
   results provide evidence that environmental institutions bring together

Abstract = {{The Indicateurs de Durabilite des Exploitations Agricoles (IDEA) method
   was adapted and used to study the sustainability of farms in the Oueme
   lower valley in the Republic of Benin. The IDEA survey was tested among
   a sample of farmers, through discussion groups at village level and via
   interviews with resource staff. The data collected were then subjected
   to binomial tests and results from the interviews subject to Student
   t-test. The study showed that some units of sustainability in the
   initial version of IDEA are applicable in the study area without
   modification. Other units, such as permanent or temporary grassland,
   were rejected as they were not considered relevant by village
   assemblies. Some elementary units, such as the spatial units of the same
   crop (indicator A6: size of plots), were reformulated to meet the local
   context. Finally, the scores for some sustainability indicators, such as
   C1 (economic viability), were adjusted to meet the local context. With
   further modification, the adapted version of the IDEA method could be
   used in other agro-ecological zones in Benin and Africa.}},

Abstract = {{Private forest owners' involvement in forest management has been
   frequently examined through the attitudes, values, beliefs, objectives
   and motivations associated with owning and managing forestland. Owners'
   views on forest management do not always align with those of
   policymakers who believe forest owners do not actively manage their
   forests. However, empirical studies on forest owners' conceptualisations
   of forest management are scarce. To determine how private forest owners
   in Europe conceptualise forest management, a survey (n = 1140) was
   undertaken in seven European countries (Portugal, France, the United
   Kingdom, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Slovakia and Romania). The owners
   were asked to indicate their level of agreement with 19 pre-tested
   statements defining forest management on a five-point Likert scale.
   Classification and regression trees were used to explain the major
   factors that influenced owners' conceptualisations. Owners primarily
   conceptualised forest management as preserving forests for future
   generations and considered ``a good business opportunity{''}, ``an
   opportunity to earn additional money{''} or a ``source of subsidies{''}
   less important. Their understanding of forest management as a mixture of
   forest maintenance, ecosystem stewardship and economic activity does not
   match with alleged policy makers' views. Property size, age and
   Eastern/Western countries were the most relevant predictors of
   definitions of forest management. Small-scale forest owners from Western
   Europe considered ecosystem orientation more important, while owners
   from Eastern Europe considered economic aspects and forest maintenance
   more important. These differences might be associated with the
   socio-political system dynamics in Europe in the 20th century and
   changing values in postmodern society. Policymakers must be aware of the
   different forest management paradigms among forest owners in
   Eastern-Central and Western Europe when designing European forest
   policies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Non-point source pollution is a cause of major concern within the
   European Union. This is reflected in increasing public and political
   focus on a more sustainable use of pesticides, as well as a reduction in
   diffuse pollution. Climate change will likely to lead to an even more
   intensive use of pesticides in the future, affecting agriculture in many
   ways. At the same time, the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and
   associated EU policies called for a ``good{''} ecological and chemical
   status to be achieved for water bodies by the end of 2015, currently
   delayed to 2021-2027 due to a lack of efficiency in policies and
   timescale of resilience for hydrosystems, especially groundwater
   systems. Water managers need appropriate and user-friendly tools to
   design agro-environmental policies. These tools should help them to
   evaluate the potential impacts of mitigation measures on water
   resources, more clearly define protected areas, and more efficiently
   distribute financial incentives to farmers who agree to implement
   alternative practices. At present, a number of reports point out that
   water managers do not use appropriate information from monitoring or
   models to make decisions and set environmental action plans. In this
   paper, we propose an integrated and collaborative approach to analyzing
   changes in land use, farming systems, and practices and to assess their
   effects on agricultural pressure and pesticide transfers to waters. The
   integrated modeling of agricultural scenario (IMAS) framework draws on a
   range of data and expert knowledge available within areas where a
   pesticide action plan can be defined to restore the water quality,
   French ``Grenelle law{''} catchment areas, French Water Development and
   Management Plan areas, etc. A so-called ``reference scenario{''}
   represents the actual soil occupation and pesticide-spraying practices
   used in both conventional and organic farming. A number of alternative
   scenarios are then defined in cooperation with stakeholders, including
   socio-economic conditions for developing alternative agricultural
   systems or targeting mitigation measures. Our integrated assessment of
   these scenarios combines the calculation of spatialized environmental
   indicators with integrated bio-economic modeling. The latter is achieved
   by a combined use of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) modeling with
   our own purpose-built land use generator module (Generator of Land Use
   version 2 (GenLU2)) and an economic model developed using General
   Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) for cost-effectiveness assessment. This
   integrated approach is applied to two embedded catchment areas (total
   area of 360,000 ha) within the Charente river basin (SW France). Our
   results show that it is possible to differentiate scenarios based on
   their effectiveness, represented by either evolution of pressure
   (agro-environmental indicators) or transport into waters (pesticide
   concentrations). By analyzing the implementation costs borne by farmers,
   it is possible to identify the most cost-effective scenarios at
   sub-basin and other aggregated levels (WFD hydrological entities,
   sensitive areas). Relevant results and indicators are fed into a
   specifically designed database. Data warehousing is used to provide
   analyses and outputs at all thematic, temporal, or spatial aggregated
   levels, defined by the stakeholders (type of crops, herbicides, WFD
   areas, years), using Spatial On-Line Analytical Processing (SOLAP)
   tools.
   The aim of this approach is to allow public policy makers to make more
   informed and reasoned decisions when managing sensitive areas and/or
   implementing mitigation measures.}},

Abstract = {{Water distribution networks are subject to potential intentional
   contaminations to cause harm to the consumer. Reliable transport models
   are needed to detect, trace and follow any contaminant transported

   However, some studies have shown that it is not always the case when

   applied to any reduced model problem including multi parameters and time

   calibrate the Kriging interpolation method parameters; then couple it

Abstract = {{Modeling of water distribution systems is fundamental for the design,
   analysis and operation of any water network. As with all hydraulic
   models, water demands are one of the most important input components in
   the model. However, estimation of the demand parameters is usually
   complicated due to the stochastic behavior of the water consumptions.
   Several methods have been proposed for estimating water demands. Most of
   them have been developed based on given frameworks where the number of
   unknown parameters is assumed to be equal or less than the number of
   measurements. The outcomes, therefore, rely on this assumption, which
   can lead to significant approximation errors in real water distribution
   systems.
   The approach proposed in this paper does not require the number of known
   inputs to be equal to the number of variables. In fact, nodes in the
   model could each have a different demand pattern. The genetic algorithm
   approach adopted here shows that the average results of multiple GA runs
   can estimate the demand patterns at each node. Moreover, the model can
   also be used to estimate the flow rates and nodal heads at non-measured
   locations of the water network, although the accuracy of the estimation
   depends on number, type and location of the measurements. Results are
   shown and discussed for a literature case study tested for a 24-hour
   time period. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Sensitivity analysis of the actual hydraulic state of water distribution
   systems is a valuable tool with number of applications in hydraulic
   systems analysis. Sensitivity matrices include the information of the
   response of the hydraulic state variables (flows, pressures) to changes
   in model parameters (e.g. demands, roughness, control parameters) for a
   specific hydraulic state of the system. For calculation, there exists in
   addition to finite difference approximations also exact solutions that
   include the inversion of the system matrix (the Schur Complement of the
   Jacobian of the hydraulic network equations). In combination with
   hydraulic network simulations, the factorization (for example Cholesky
   matrix decomposition) of the matrix that has already been done by the
   hydraulic solver in the computation process can be used for the
   efficient calculation of the inverse matrix. However, for large
   realworld networks the sensitivity calculation is a time and memory
   consuming process because the inverse of the system matrix of a
   connected network has no zero elements. In this paper a new method is
   presented that allows for the exact calculation of sensitivities of a
   particular subgraph of interest, the topological minor or supergraph
   within a water distribution system network graph. Supernodes are the
   most important nodes in terms of connectivity redundancy within the
   network graph. Superlinks replace all pipes (links) in series between
   two supernodes. It will be shown that the sensitivities that are
   calculated for the subgraph deliver exactly the same results as the
   inversion of the entire system matrix reduced to supernodes. This paper
   focuses on the derivation of the equations for the reduced system matrix
   inversion of the topological subgraph. In addition, the paper includes
   the proof of equivalence of the matrix inverses for the topological
   minor subgraph. This inverse represents the fundamental sensitivities of
   nodal heads and pipe flows with respect to nodal demands in demand
   driven analysis. The results presented can be extended to other
   sensitivities, since the matrix inverse in question is included in all
   other derived parameter sensitivities. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published

Title = {{Greening European water policy, experimentalist governance and policy

Journal = {{POLITIQUE EUROPEENNE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{55}},

Abstract = {{Until the 1990s, the European water policy has been defined by and for
   water users abstracting water or discharging waste through water
   infrastructures: urban water services, irrigated agriculture and
   industries discharging pollutants into rivers. The European Water
   Framework directive (WFD) issued in 2000 departs from this sectorial
   stance. It regulates all continental aquatic systems in order to take
   into account cumulative effects of environmental degradations. This
   article evaluates the ecologisation of the European water policy through
   its instruments of regulation and governance. It presents a typology of
   policy learning in relation to their sector-based or ecological
   orientation in a multilevel context. At European level, the enactment of
   the WFD may be explained by mere strategic learning. Its implementation
   at French level requires further elaboration and implies : (1)
   sector-based strategic learning fostering equipment; (2) ecological
   conceptual learning; and (3) uncertainties generated by new
   commensuration process. In this case, ecological mainstreaming proceeds
   along two avenues : recycling of previously marginal ecological tools
   designed within the water sector and ignorance of new tools and other
   actors strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Estimation of annual average water demand figures is critical for the
   design and evaluation of water distribution systems. This study
   evaluated the metered water consumption of more than 67,000 non-domestic
   consumers in six categories from cities and towns in South Africa. It
   was found that lognormal distributions provide good descriptions of the
   annual average daily demand (AADD) distribution in each category. The
   land use categories Business Commercial, Industrial, Agricultural
   holdings and Sports \& Parks displayed similar median AADDs of between
   1.5 and 1.7 kl/property/day. Educational properties used substantially
   more water (4.7 kl/property/day), while Government \& Institutional
   properties used substantially less water (0.7 kl/property/day). A
   step-wise regression analyses showed that property size has the greatest
   impact on water demand for most categories. Finally, a novel
   statistically based method is proposed for estimating the average AADD
   of a given number of properties based on an acceptable risk of
   non-exceedance.}},

Title = {{Impact of justice and solidarity variables on the acceptability of
   managed realignment}},
Journal = {{CLIMATE POLICY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{361-377}},
Abstract = {{Sea-level rise due to climate change will have significant effects on
   coastal areas and populations. Adaptation policies recommend the managed
   realignment of the most vulnerable assets and activities. Despite their
   medium-and long-term benefits, these policies face significant friction
   due to social acceptability in the communities where they are
   implemented.
   This article investigates the hypothesis that respecting principles of
   justice in the implementation of managed realignment should increase its
   acceptability. We compare preferences of those people who are exposed to
   the risk of climate-change-induced flooding and those who are not, as
   regards funding managed retreat policies and defining compensation
   criteria for assets at risk. The main theories of social justice provide
   the four principles included in the analysis: efficiency, need,
   responsibility and priority assigned to property rights.
   A choice experiment survey was conducted with 258 residents of coastal
   and hinterland communities in the south of France. Four attributes were
   selected to define the managed realignment policy: the dialogue
   arrangements, the implementation period, the policy implementation
   schedule and the cost. The results show support for a relatively fast
   launch of these policies (within 15 years) but in stages and through a
   process of dialogue with the population. People's perceptions of the
   funding criteria reveal a preference for national solidarity. Finally,
   national funding of managed retreat policies and compensation criteria
   based on market prices have a significant positive influence on the
   acceptability of managed realignment policies, whereas introducing
   responsibility-based compensation criteria tends to favour the status
   quo over the adaptation policy.
   Policy relevance
   Prioritization of the funding criteria reveals the preference for
   national solidarity. Preferences for the justice criteria underpinning
   compensation reveal a great diversity of values. Besides implantation
   modalities, preferences for managed realignment policies depend on which
   level they are implemented at, on the expropriation criteria (the
   emphasis given to property rights, i.e. market price), on the attachment
   (people perceived as worst off, i.e. the property is their main
   residence rather than a second home or they have lower levels of income)
   and on the degree of responsibility (related to the date of purchase,
   i.e. on the information given at the time on the risk).}},

Journal = {{WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{The focus of ecosystem restoration has recently shifted from pure
   rehabilitation objectives to both improving ecological functioning and
   the delivery of ecosystem services. However, these different targets
   need to be integrated to create a unified, synergistic, and balanced
   restoration approach. This should be done by combining state-of-the-art
   knowledge from natural and social sciences to create manageable units of
   restoration that consider both the temporal and multiple spatial scales
   of ecosystems, legislative units, and policy agendas. Only by
   considering these aspects combined can we accomplish more cost-efficient
   restoration resulting in resilient ecosystems that provide a wealth of
   ecosystem services and the possibility for sustainable economic
   development in the future. We propose a novel conceptual framework that
   will yield more effective ecosystem restoration: the Operational
   Restoration Unit. This is based on scale-dependent restoration actions
   that can adhere easily to the relevant environmental legislation,
   encompass the spatial and temporal resilience of aquatic ecosystems, and
   consider the sum of human pressures acting on water bodies. This opens
   up possibilities for an effective integration of the restoration agenda
   into the delivery of major policy objectives of economic growth,
   regional development, and human security. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{This article reflects on the idea of being `green' along with the

   the process of becoming so, in France and Canada, the authors try to
   decipher the often ambiguous relationship with nature. The nature wished
   for is not natural and natural nature is not wished for. The research
   study found that, while those who practice leisure activities claimed to
   be seeking fusion with the wilderness, their search for what is
   aesthetically pleasing and their need for access led them back to a
   `managed' nature. That is to say, a nature managed by people who, at the
   same time, control access, and which is all the more legitimate in these
   territories since environmental issues have been defined which rarely
   take social construction into account. Behind the ideal of `the wild,'
   being green, rather, participates in domesticating the uses of nature,
   thereby contributing to a new form of social control.}},

Abstract = {{We explore the connections between the concepts of governance and
   sustainability and discuss their possible roles in water and sanitation
   management systems (WSMS). We see governance as a decision-making
   process that drives the relationship between social institutions and the
   public affairs of a given society. We understand sustainability as a
   combination of spatial, temporal, and personal aspects, and we argue
   that this definition is more comprehensive than the traditional triple
   bottom line of economy, environment, and society. We combined these two
   concepts into a new conceptual framework of ``governance for
   sustainability{''} that is theoretically sound and arguably appropriate
   to understand local WSMS. To illustrate this framework, we developed and
   estimated a Sustainable Water Governance Index (SWGI) for the city of
   Salta, Argentina. This aggregated index was calculated with data from
   literature, information from the city's water company and other local
   institutions, field visits, and interviews. The SWGI for Salta obtained
   an overall score of 49 on a 0-100 scale, which fell into the
   ``danger{''} range. We discuss the advantages and limitations of the
   method and conclude that aggregated indices such as the SWGI,
   complemented with contextual information, can be a helpful
   decision-making tool to promote more sustainable WSMS.}},

Abstract = {{The environmental services that farmers perform for the community are

   likely to encourage them to perform such services. With regard to

   shows that though most stockbreeders do not share the notion of
   landscape diffused by public policy programs, some are quite willing to
   participate in those programs while others participate only
   exceptionally. Analyzing these farmers' technical thinking as producers
   in connection with how service to the landscape is conceptualized in
   environmental economics allows for identifying farmers' reasons and
   understanding the aforecited divergence between them. It also suggests
   that the notion of involvement is more relevant here than
   intentionality, while revealing major tension between local communities'
   regulation of the agricultural landscape and the regulation implemented
   by the public authorities, emphasizing service to the environment.}},
