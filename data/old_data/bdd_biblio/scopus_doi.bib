abstract={In this paper a new method is proposed that solves for the steady state of pressure-dependent models (PDMs) with flow control valves. Rather than model flow devices individually, the method solves the more general problem in which a water distribution system (WDS) has some link flows constrained to lie between upper and lower, or possibly equal, set limits. No heuristics are used to determine device states. The method is shown to be fast, and its effectiveness is demonstrated on PDM WDSs with up to about 20,000 links and 18,000 nodes and 60 link flow constraints, some of which prescribe a fixed flow. The method has applications in network management, network design, and flow control to deal with water distribution where there is insufficient supply. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={To date, the hydraulics of water distribution networks are calculated using deterministic models. Because many of the parameters in these models are not known exactly, it is important to evaluate the effects of their uncertainties on the results through uncertainty analysis. For the propagation of uncertain parameters, this article for the first time applies the polynomial chaos expansion to a hydraulic model and compares the results with those from classical approaches like the first-order second-moment method and Monte Carlo simulations. Results presented in this article show that the accuracy of the polynomial chaos expansion is on the same level as the Monte Carlo simulation. Further, it is concluded that due to its computational efficiency, polynomial chaos expansion is superior to the Monte Carlo simulation. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={In Ireland the political consensus to expand forest cover has not been really questioned for the last five decades, neither by policy-makers nor by forest owners’ representatives. However, in 2014, Irish private forest owners experienced for the first time in their life a catastrophic windstorm. A qualitative survey, conducted among the forest owners affected by the storm, shows that beyond the economic losses this disaster deeply shook their convictions about the real benefits of afforestation programmes. Using the theoretical concept of relational expectations, we show that Storm Darwin deconstructed a significant part of their identity as their status switched from audacious pioneer to forestry loser overnight. The political and socio-economic structures outweighed the agency of individuals and their initial desire not to reforest. While the reconstitution scheme gave them the direction to follow, it reduced the risk of desertion. However, our study also shows that landowners may be a lot more cautious before signing up for afforestation programmes in the future. © 2019 The Authors.

abstract={Water distributions networks (WDNs) are exposed to multiple hazards, leading the network to operate under a range of critical conditions. This paper explored the relationship between the impact of anomalous events (AEs) of WDNs and the consequent palliative actions (PAs) to be implemented in the network to minimize such impact. Both AEs and PAs were assessed through a network resilience criticality index adapted to WDNs. The results were compared with those obtained from normal operating conditions with respect to the satisfaction rate of nodal demands. The proposal was evaluated by two case studies. The first corresponded to a small synthetic network and the second to a medium-size utility network. After a pipe burst event analysis, two different isolation actions were scrutinized in each of the two WDNs. The results quantify system resilience and support water utility managers in further decision-making processes. This is done through critical resilience indicators that provide information and support for better crisis preparedness (planning) and management (mitigation). © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={Global private sustainability standards in agriculture today govern a range of commodities produced in the tropics. Our study analyses the most well-established of these standards, namely the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). We show how, far from being a market device restricted to re-organising global markets in palm oil, RSPO standardisation has wider consequences spatially re-distributing power with territorial effects. Territorialisation occurs through two processes: a strategic and operational process linked to the fabrication and application of procedural rules; a socio-technological process linked to the valorisation of managerial approaches to sustainability. Over time, these twin processes have institutionalised a transnational political space of action with territorial properties. These include: new frontiers of political authority de-bordering national jurisdiction (geographically connecting local scale oil palm estates and plantations with a transversal global supply chain stretching from producing to consuming countries); historical connection; internal coherence and imposition of managerial practices and discourses, including managerial constructions of interdependencies between people, nature and artefacts; prime beneficiaries (large southeast Asian growers, international environmental NGOs and (mainly) European downstream firms); marginalised people (independent smallholders and communities in Malaysia and Indonesia). In this manner, RSPO reinforces its political power and authority over a managerial form of sustainability of palm oil production through territorialising it. Ultimately, this transnational political space of action comes into interaction (and, potentially, conflict) with other political spaces of action and territorial projects as pursued by local people, other NGOs or Malaysian and Indonesian state governments. © 2019},

abstract={On-site wastewater treatment systems are approved by the French regulation based on the results of platform tests following the European standard NF EN 12566-3. In addition to this approval for the treatment system, at least 90% of outlet concentrations have to be below 30 mg L1 for total suspended solids (TSS) and 35 mg L1 for biochemical oxygen demand. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effluent quality of these treatment systems on site, i.e. under real operating conditions, and to assess their performances. Between 2011 and 2016, 1,286 treated wastewater samples were taken from 231 on-site sanitation facilities in France. Data collected are heterogeneous and a robust statistical methodology (using a generalized log-linear model) was used to study the effects of four explanatory variables (treatment systems, loading rate, aging and sampling methods) on the distribution of treated wastewater concentrations. The model calculates median outlet concentrations depending on the effects identified. Its application allowed studying and comparing the outlet median concentrations of 21 on-site sanitation systems classified into nine categories and three groups. Four treatment systems out of the 21 monitored showed TSS median outlet concentrations below 10 mg L1 and four treatment systems have TSS medians higher than the regulatory threshold of 30 mg L1 © IWA Publishing 2019.},

abstract={The protection of environmental flows is a main challenge pursued by water regulating agencies in their groundwater management policies. A stylised hydro-economic model with natural drainage is used to compare the outcome of the optimal control approach in which environmental flows are introduced as an externality with the viable approach in which environmental flows are modelled as a constraint to satisfy. The optimal and viable paths for the water table, water extraction for irrigation and environmental flows are analytically derived together with their long-term values. We show how results are sensitive to some key parameters like the discount factor and the monetary value of the externality in the optimal control approach. We show how the value of the environmental flows target in the viable approach can be derived from the optimal control approach. Numerical simulations based on the Western La Mancha aquifer illustrate the main results of the study. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper analyzes transmission system operator (TSO)-host community negotiations over an efficient and socially-optimal compensation payment for the installation of new electric power transmission lines. We consider that the TSO has an incentive to negotiate over a transfer that will become a function of final demand. We thus develop a bargaining game within a vertical relationship framework to include the distribution system operator (DSO) and the end-users at the downside of the bargaining problem. We determine the equilibrium of the game, for three negotiation protocols (sequential, bilateral, and multilateral) as an alternative to the non-cooperative situation. We show that when the number of municipalities involved in the process is higher than 5, the multilateral bargaining procedure is the most profitable for all agents, including the municipalities. Inversely, when the number of municipalities is lower than 5, different cases can arise. A single municipality will prefer the non-cooperative outcome while municipalities will prefer the sequential case when there are 2 or the bilateral case when there are 3 or 4. However, from the TSO standpoint and for the society, multilateral negotiations are always the best outcome. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Modern water distribution networks (WDNs) are complex and difficult to manage due to increased level of urbanization, varying consumer demands, ageing infrastructure, operational costs, and inadequate water resources. The management problems in such complex networks may be classified into short-term, medium-term, and long-term, depending on the duration at which the problems are solved or considered. To address the management problems associated with WDNs, mathematical models facilitate analysis and improvement of the performance of water infrastructure at minimum operational cost, and have been used by researchers, water utility managers, and operators. This paper presents a detailed review of the management problems and essential mathematical models that are used to address these problems at various phases of WDNs. In addition, it also discusses the main approaches to address these management problems to meet customer demands at the required pressure in terms of adequate water quantity and quality. Key challenges that are associated with the management of WDNs are discussed.

abstract={Facing sea-level rise, scientists recommend adaptation measures to relocate the most vulnerable assets. This is of particular interest regarding coastal land use management issues. In order to address the acceptability of these measures, we use the choice experiment method to assess residents' preferences for different relocation policy measures that differs according to four attributes. A survey was implemented in the South of France involving 240 people evenly distributed between coastal and hinterland residents. The latent class logit modelling reveals the heterogeneity of preferences via two classes depending on risk perception: residents who may be described as “unaware individualists”, generally opposed to relocation, and those who display “informed solidarity”, generally in favour of this policy. Furthermore, people the more frequently exposed to the risk reveal an optimism bias. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The increasing number of coastal floods in recent years in France has resulted in the design of new adaptation principles for the most endangered coastal areas. The aim of the government is to reduce the vulnerability of these areas by relocating property and infrastructure. These measures have, however, come up against considerable opposition from the population concerned. Using a survey of 421 inhabitants of Hyères, a coastal town in the South of France, this article proposes the study of resistance to relocation through the creation of an index for resistance that incorporates attachment to place, residential mobility and risk perception. The results show a correlation for the index and distance from the sea that highlights the existence of conflicting interests with adaptation measures depending upon population categories. Key policy insights In France, although coastal flooding risk is a key issue in numerous populated coastal areas, coastal dwellers show little willingness to relocate. Resistance to relocation can be assessed through a composite index integrating place attachment, residential mobility and risk perception. Application of such an index shows a correlation between willingness to relocate and distance from the sea. Conflicts of interest with adaptation measures also depend on the age of the dwellers, their standard of living and on home ownership. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={This study analyses the linkages between private forest owners’ perceptions of forest management, and their affinity for subsidies, in a range of European countries. Society increasingly requires the provision of ecosystem services from forests, but the willingness of forest owners to redirect management goals from wood production to the provision of public goods is crucial for sustaining ecosystem services. EU incentives in the forestry sector are still mainly oriented towards an anthropocentric vision of forest management. Forest owners and managers are diverse, and although many efforts have been made to understand the role of forest subsidies in private forest management, it is still necessary to analyse the different perspectives on forest subsidies with a regional comparative approach. This paper explores European private forest owners’ affinity for subsidies – through survey data at European level—and estimates an ordered probit model to (i) analyse how private forest owners in Europe respond to subsidies in forestry, including regional differences in terms of affinity for subsidies, (ii) characterize the factors that influence these responses and (iii) discuss lessons learned related to forest owners’ attitudes on subsidies and the implications for introducing similar kind of incentives such as payments for ecosystem services. Simulations were conducted to examine the potential effects of changes in property fragmentation or the time allotted to forest activities. Forest owners with an utilitarian view of forest management, bigger forest holdings, full or part-time farmers and forest owners from East Europe are most in favour of forest subsidies. Property fragmentation and absenteeism decreases affinity for subsidies. © 2018},

abstract={This article presents the fourth version of the conceptual framework used in the "IDEA" method (Indicateurs de durabilité des exploitations agricoles or Farm Sustainability Indicators) (IDEA v4). It combines two approaches: one based on sustainable agriculture goals and the other applying a systemic approach focusing on the properties of sustainable agricultural systems. The IDEA v4 method includes both strong sustainability and agricultural multifunctionality paradigms. It takes into account the global challenges of sustainable agriculture. Using this framework, we were able to develop 53 indicators to assess the sustainability of a given farm using two complementary approaches. The first approach assesses sustainability by dividing these 53 indicators into 13 components, according to the 3 normative dimensions of sustainable development (agroecological, socio-territorial, economic). This assessment process is based on a scoring system using 100 units for each dimension. There is no compensation between the scores of the three dimensions. The second approach assesses the level of sustainability based on 5 properties of sustainable agricultural systems (autonomy, robustness, ability to produce and reproduce goods and services, territorial embeddedness and overall responsibility), using a tree structure. This second approach is divided into 15 constituent branches of the 5 properties. The 53 indicators are aggregated with a qualitative and hierarchical approach, using the DEXi tool. This concept can be used for education, through a transdisciplinary teaching process. Following on from its three previous versions, IDEA v4 can also be used as a tool to support the process of agroecological transition. © F. Zahm et al., Published by EDP Sciences 2019.},

abstract={A new content-based, box-constrained, active-set projected Newton method is presented that solves for the heads, the pipe flows, and the nodal outflows of a water distribution system in which nodal outflows are pressure dependent. The new method is attractive because, by comparison with the previously published weighted least-squares energy and mass residuals (EMR) damped Newton method, (1) it typically takes fewer iterations, (2) it does not require damping, (3) it takes less wall-clock time, (4) it does not require the addition of any virtual elements, and (5) it is algorithmically easier to deal with. Various pressure-outflow relationships (PORs), which model nodal outflows, were considered and two new PORs are presented. The new method is shown, by application to eight previously published case study networks with up to about 20,000 pipes and 18,000 nodes, to be up to five times faster than the EMR method and to take between 34% and 70% fewer iterations than the EMR method. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={If forest policies aim to orientate forest owners’ behaviours, some gaps still remain between policy makers’ objectives and forest owners’ final decision. In order to understand where these discrepancies come from, we propose a conceptual framework which analyse forest owners’ decision-making through the combination of four individual logics of action (utilitarism, appropriateness, cognition, and practices) and five main structural factors (forest policies, market, environment, knowledge, and social norms). Instead of identifying a profusion of very accurate profiles often too specific to a regional or national context, we also aim at attempting a generalization of “forest owners meta-profiles”. Finally we distinguish five ones: “optimizers or economy-oriented” “satisfiers or traditional knowledge oriented” “passive or outsider” “environmentally-oriented” and “multifunctional public forest managers” Following this classification, we analysed the influence of structural factors such as public policies, market, environmental issues, knowledge, and social norms on decision making. Beyond this typology, we also identify some major trends in forest owners’ attitudes: firstly, we show that forest owners adopt more easily forest policies which support the management activities that they have planned. They also may reshape those who do not fit with their goals. Although forest owners are not particularly in favour of the coercive power of the state, they appreciate this political authority as it create a legitimate arbiter and mediator for formal and negotiated agreements. Secondly, if the logic of utilitarism and factors as wood market are still important drivers for action, the respect of social norms (such as protecting the environment or managing the forest for public goods) gives less-profit-oriented forest owners a new legitimacy for action that did not exist 20 years ago. Finally, we also raise questions about the emergence of new forest owners who may reconsider their roles, and redefine forestry norms in the future instead of just following the rules. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This article analyzes the variety of governance arrangements in the forest sector by examining the situation in ten European countries. At the national level, governance arrangements in the forest sector are analysed as a specific set of ideas, rules and relationships that shape and steer the decision-making process and determine (i) the policy framework, (ii) the forms of authority and power distribution, and (iii) the mediation pattern and network relationships. The study reveals that network governance, new policy instruments and ideational innovation have definitely emerged in the European forest sector, but, at its core, state forestry still dominates. That finding puts the shift from government to governance into perspective as well as the extent to which new forestry discourses are being put into practice. The article concludes that recent (gradual) changes in governance arrangements in the forest sector result from macro political trends, such as global and European discourses and guidelines on sustainability and good governance, on the one hand, and from the maintenance of the strategic key position of national states in European forest policies on the other. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a Ward-like hierarchical clustering algorithm including spatial/geographical constraints. Two dissimilarity matrices D0 and D1 are inputted, along with a mixing parameter α∈ [0 , 1]. The dissimilarities can be non-Euclidean and the weights of the observations can be non-uniform. The first matrix gives the dissimilarities in the “feature space” and the second matrix gives the dissimilarities in the “constraint space”. The criterion minimized at each stage is a convex combination of the homogeneity criterion calculated with D0 and the homogeneity criterion calculated with D1. The idea is then to determine a value of α which increases the spatial contiguity without deteriorating too much the quality of the solution based on the variables of interest i.e. those of the feature space.

abstract={The historical record of the definition of forest management and policy principles is a contentious one, characterized by tensions and conflicts between and among public authorities, private stakeholders and citizens. This paper is an empirical and analytical contribution to the understanding of the political and socio-economic factors influencing the integration of stakes in forest-dominated landscapes. Based on a case study of the ‘Landes de Gascogne’ forest region (southwestern France), it explores an apparent paradox that sees local landowners, following a massive storm damage, re-afforesting a Pinus pinaster plantation on a technical basis they know to be vulnerable. The authors highlight how, on which basis and by whom discourses and practices on forest integration have been sustained over decades in ‘Landes’ albeit being in fact reinvented on very different grounds—in a setting similar to the famous quote of the novel Il Gattopardo. The idea of a forest massif is identified as the object of most efforts, enabling the strategical use of three entwined perspectives: as a cultivated forest, a multifunctional land-use and an integrated chain. Ending with an analysis of the interplays of these dimensions, the paper further demonstrates the relevance of landscape and relational approaches to grasp the determinants of forest land-use conflicts. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This paper studies the risk attitudes of winegrowers in France. In French viticulture, most of the production is done under an appellation regime that constrains maximum authorized yields. We consider a trans-log cost function under the constraint of this maximum yield and estimate winegrowers' attitudes to risk. Our estimates are based on the European Farm Accountancy Data Network database (2005-2014) and data from the French National Institute of Origin and Quality. We find that winegrowers are risk averse. For the majority of winegrowers, risk aversion is declining with expected profit. In the Champagne region, however, where expected profits are far higher than in the other regions, we observe the reverse relation: winegrowers become more risk averse as expected profits rise.

abstract={River quality trajectories are presented for (i) organic pollution, (ii) eutrophication, (iii) nitrate pollution, and (iv) metal contamination over the Longue Durée (130 to 70 years). They are defined by a quantified state indicator (S) specific to each issue, compared to drivers (D) or pressures (P) and to social responses (R) that reflect the complex interactions between society and river quality. The Lower Seine River, naturally sensitive to anthropogenic pressures, greatly impacted by Paris urban growth, industrialization, and intensive agriculture, and well documented by the PIREN-Seine 25-year research program, was chosen to illustrate these trajectories. State indicators, dissolved oxygen, algal pigments, nitrate, and heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb, Zn) in sediments have only been monitored by river basin authorities since 1971. Therefore, their past changes have been reconstructed using three approaches: (i) reassessment of historical sources, (ii) pressure-state models that reconstruct past water quality, and (iii) sedimentary archives of past persistent contamination from dated floodplain cores. The indicators were then transformed into river quality status using contemporary water quality criteria throughout these records. Each environmental issue shows specific trajectories because each has its own relationship between the issue evidence and the social response, but all are characterized by very poor quality in the past, largely ignored: the long-term summer hypoxia (<1880–1995), the summer eutrophication peak (1965–2005), the growing nitrate level since the 1950s, recently stabilized but still high, and the extreme metal contamination (>1935–2000) that peaked in the 1960s. The efficiency of social responses has been highly variable but more efficient in the last 15–25 years. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The reliability of a water distribution system is highly dependent on the management of its pipeline network. A pipe or a portion of the network can be isolated for inspection, maintenance, and replacement by the installation of isolation valves along the pipelines. However, the presence of isolation valves may cause a large discrepancy in the hydraulic behavior between the real system and results from a simulation model if the statuses of some of the valves in the system are unknown. Possible problems related to these valves are missing valves in the model due to poor or nonexistent documentation, errors in data transfer, or valve mechanical failure. This paper introduces an innovative methodology for the identification of unknown partially/fully closed valves in a water distribution network. An optimization problem is formulated for the unknown valve issue and solved by application of three sequentially applied methods, which include a local sensitivity analysis, an application of genetic algorithms (GAs), and an application of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. In the first method, the sensitivity of the flow rates and nodal heads at measurement locations with respect to the change in the minor losses of the valves is computed. This computation is used to identify the valves that are unable to be localized by the measurement data. The second method applies a genetic algorithm combined with an extended period simulation in order to preliminarily identify the locations of the partially/fully closed valves and their setting values, i.e., the degree of opening of the valve. Finally, the application of the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm was implemented to correct the results from the GA model. Results and discussions from two case studies show that the proposed methodologies can solve real-world problems. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={This article proposes an innovative approach to assess the benefits of adapting to sea level rise (SLR) in a coastal area on a regional scale. The valuation framework integrates coastal ecosystem services, together with urban and agricultural assets. We simulate the impacts of a progressive 1 m rise in sea level in the twenty-first century and an extreme flooding event in 2100 for four contrasted adaptation scenarios (Denial, “Laissez-faire”, Protection and Retreat). The assessment involves coupling the results of hazard-modelling approaches with different economic valuation methods, including direct damage functions and methods used in environmental economics. The framework is applied to the French Mediterranean sandy coastline. SLR will result in major land-use changes at the 2100 time horizon: relocation or densification of urban areas, loss of agricultural land, increase in lagoon areas and modification of wetlands (losses, migration or extension of ecosystems). Total benefits of public adaptation options planned in advance could reach €31.2 billion for the period 2010–2100, i.e. €69,000 per inhabitant (in the study area) in 2010 or €135 million/km of coastline. Our results highlight the importance of (i) raising awareness to ensure that public services and coastal managers can anticipate the consequences of SLR and (ii) incorporating coastal ecosystems into the assessment of the adaptation options. Our findings could provide a basis for participatory foresight approaches to build coastline adaptation pathways. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Private forests are widespread in Europe providing a range of ecosystem services of significant value to society, and there are calls for novel policies to enhance their provision and to face the challenges of environmental changes. Such policies need to acknowledge the importance of private forests, and importantly they need to be based on a deep understanding of how property rights held by private forest owners vary across Europe. We collected and analysed data on the content of property rights based on formal legal requirements existing in 31 European jurisdictions. To allow a comparison across jurisdictions, we constructed an original Property Rights Index for Forestry encompassing five rights domains (access, withdrawal, management, exclusion and alienation). We documented substantial variation of the private forest owners’ rights, and notably to i) make decisions in operational management and the formulation of management goals, ii) withdraw timber resources from their forest, and iii) exclude others from the use of forest resources. We identified broad relations between the scope for decision making of private forest owners and jurisdictions’ former socio-political background and geographical distribution. The variation in the content of property rights has implications for the implementation of international environmental policies, and stresses the need for tailored policy instruments, when addressing European society's rural development, the bioeconomy, climate change mitigation measures and nature protection strategies. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Uncertainty surrounding climate change has encouraged policy makers to engage in flexible and exploratory policies and forms of policy making. The article examines the potential of experimentation in devising coastal adaptation policies, taking into account its political dimensions. We analysed a multi-level experiment, funded by the French Ministry for the Environment from 2012 to 2015, where coastal municipalities volunteered to simulate the implementation of planned retreat as an adaptation strategy. Using insights from discursive institutionalism, we tracked developments throughout the experiment period. We highlight a combined process of governance experiment, allowing social innovation at local and regional scales, and a more strategic tool for the state, governing and steering local coastal policy with new instruments. We shed light on a particular policy entrepreneur (a public organization dealing with coastal management) playing at the intersection of these two forms, and in the interplay of policy scales. Although the experiment contributed to the innovation of legal and economic instruments and produced policy feedbacks in local planning and governance, learning capacities of the multi-scale architecture are still moderate to make planned retreat a reality in the near future. The conclusion considers performative and interpretive effects of policy experiments as further research questions to explore. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Ecosystem fragmentation is a serious threat to biodiversity and one of the main challenges in ecosystem restoration. River continuity restoration (RCR) has often targeted diadromous fishes, a group of species supporting strong cultural and economic values and especially sensitive to river fragmentation. Yet it has frequently produced mixed results and diadromous fishes remain at very low levels of abundance. Against this background, this paper presents the main challenges for defining, evaluating and achieving effective RCR. We first identify challenges specific to disciplines. In ecology, there is a need to develop quantitative and mechanistic models to support decision making, accounting for both direct and indirect impacts of river obstacles and working at the river catchment scale. In a context of dwindling abundances and reduced market value, cultural services provided by diadromous fishes are becoming increasingly prominent. Methods for carrying out economic quantification of non-market values of diadromous fishes become ever more urgent. Given current challenges for rivers to meet all needs sustainably, conflicts arise over the legitimate use of water resources for human purposes. Concepts and methods from political science and geography are needed to develop understandings on how the political work of public authorities and stakeholders can influence the legitimacy of restoration projects. Finally, the most exciting challenge is to combine disciplinary outcomes to achieve a multidisciplinary approach to RCR. Accordingly, the co-construction of intermediary objects and diagrams of flows of knowledge among disciplines can be first steps towards new frameworks supporting restoration design and planning. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The forest core partitioning algorithm (FCPA) and the fast graph matrix partitioning algorithm (GMPA) have been used to improve efficiency in the determination of the steady-state heads and flows of water distribution systems that have large, complex network graphs. In this paper, a single framework for the FCPA and the GMPA is used to extend their application from demand dependent models to pressure dependent models (PDMs). The PDM topological minor (TM) is characterized, important properties of its key matrices are identified, and efficient evaluation schemes for the key matrices are presented. The TM captures the network's most important characteristics: It has exactly the same number of loops as the full network, and the flows and heads of those elements not in the TM depend linearly on those of the TM. The inverse of the TM's Schur complement is shown to be the top, left block of the inverse of the full system Jacobian's Schur complement, thereby providing information about the system's essential behavior more economically than is otherwise possible. The new results are applicable to other nonlinear network problems, such as in gas, district heating, and electrical distribution. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={The overarching aim of this review paper is to investigate the involvement of experts, citizens, and participatory professionals in forest policy decision-making processes. Three interpretations of governance are distinguished to translate the idea of an orchestra to European (forest) policy making processes, referring to Frank Fischer's differentiation between a centralised state guided by administrative and policy experts on the one hand and deliberative governance driven by citizen participation on the other and a form of governance by participation professionals. The review included in total 81 research articles published between 1998 and 2015 addressing participation and expert involvement in forest policy. The results show that governance by participatory professionals is clearly visible in forest policy making processes in Europe mainly involving traditional groups as forest owners. Whether these participation professionals are engaged in a deliberative process with citizens remains unanswered. The results furthermore show a strong involvement of experts though the literature is rather silent as to how this steering of experts evolves in participatory forest processes. Finally the analysis shows that governance by citizen participation is rather neglected in forest policy processes in Europe. It is perceived as difficult to pursue, even at the local level. Therefore this article found nearly no empirical evidence for a so-called citizen's orchestra with the competence to self-align by deliberation. Instead citizens seem to be no part of the orchestra itself, but remain outside as part of the audience. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Water scarcity is a harsh reality for many regions. As a result, reducing losses from water supply systems (WSSs) is of great environmental importance around the world. In France, water suppliers are legally bound to reduce losses from their WSSs through loss reduction action plans (LRAPs). For these plans to work, they need to suit the area to which they are applied. Their impacts on water bodies (WBs) and the environment also need to be taken into account. This paper explains an innovative approach to fulfil these objectives. It involves adding two elements to the design of LRAPs: calculation of a water abstraction and discharge balance (WADB) and analysis of environmental effects (AEE) relating to loss reduction actions, based on life cycle assessment. The usefulness and the practicality of this approach are examined through two practical case studies. It is shown that the WADB allows LRAPs to be configured to optimise water savings in the most sensitive WBs. AEE makes it possible to identify a loss reduction level above which the overall environmental balance becomes negative. While the LRAP design and the WADB calculation methods are ready to be used by WSS managers, the AEE still requires further improvement. © IWA Publishing 2018.},

abstract={It has been well established in several experimental and modeling studies that leak areas are often not fixed, but vary as linear functions of pressure. Replacing this linear equation into the orifice equation results in a two-part modified orifice leakage equation with head exponents of 0.5 and 1.5. The purpose of this study was to incorporate the modified orifice equation into the hydraulic network formulation and evaluate its impact on model performance. The conventional and modified software were applied to 600 instances of stochastic leakage distributions in three different pipe networks. It was found that the conventional power leakage equation results in significant leakage volume and flow-rate errors under certain conditions. In addition, a problem of nonconvergence of the conventional global gradient algorithm for leakage exponents greater than 2 was observed and is discussed. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={Performing a comprehensive risk analysis is primordial to ensure a reliable and sustainable water supply. Though the general framework of risk analysis is well established, specific adaptation seems needed for systems such as water distribution networks (WDN). Understanding of vulnerabilities of WDN against deliberate contamination and consumers’ sensitivity against contaminated water use is very vital to inform decision-maker. This paper presents an innovative step-by-step methodology for developing comprehensive indicators to perform sensitivity, vulnerability and criticality analyses in case of absence of early warning system (EWS). The assessment and the aggregation of these indicators with specific fuzzy operators allow identifying the most critical points in a WDN. Intentional intrusion of contaminants at these points can potentially harm both the consumers as well as water infrastructure. The implementation of the developed methodology has been demonstrated through a case study of a French WDN unequipped with sensors. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Motivated by this need, this paper provides insights to the broad question: why does collaborative river basin management in France depend so heavily on partnerships made up around a few actors? Accordingly, our analytical framework develops a transaction cost explanation for the extent to which participatory procedures help stakeholders to identify partners and initiate collaboration, and for the causal link between the attributes of these stakeholders and their partnerships. The p2 model is implemented to investigate partnership networks of the key actors that govern the management of the Gironde estuary, the study case. The results provide evidence that environmental institutions bring together heterogeneous actors who might not be ready for collaboration, thereby actors’ perceived power similarity; their geographical proximity and co-presence in formal fora limit transaction costs. © 2017 Newcastle University.},

abstract={The calculation of hydraulic state variables for a network is an important task in managing the distribution of potable water. Over the years the mathematical modeling process has been improved by numerous researchers for utilization in new computer applications and the more realistic modeling of water distribution networks.

This paper will take a closer look at the two modeling paradigms given by demand-A nd pressure-driven modeling. The basic equations are introduced and parallels are drawn with the optimization formulations from electrical engineering. These formulations guarantee the existence and uniqueness of the solution. One of the central questions of the French and German research project ResiWater is the investigation of the network resilience in the case of extreme events or disasters. Under such extraordinary conditions where models are pushed beyond their limits, we talk about deficient network models. Examples of deficient networks are given by highly regulated flow, leakage or pipe bursts and cases where pressure falls below the vapor pressure of water. These examples will be presented and analyzed on the solvability and physical correctness of the solution with respect to demand-A nd pressure-driven models. © 2017 Author(s).},

abstract={The Indicateurs de Durabilité des Exploitations Agricoles (IDEA) method was adapted and used to study the sustainability of farms in the Ouémé lower valley in the Republic of Benin. The IDEA survey was tested among a sample of farmers, through discussion groups at village level and via interviews with resource staff. The data collected were then subjected to binomial tests and results from the interviews subject to Student t-test. The study showed that some units of sustainability in the initial version of IDEA are applicable in the study area without modification. Other units, such as permanent or temporary grassland, were rejected as they were not considered relevant by village assemblies. Some elementary units, such as the spatial units of the same crop (indicator A6: size of plots), were reformulated to meet the local context. Finally, the scores for some sustainability indicators, such as C1 (economic viability), were adjusted to meet the local context. With further modification, the adapted version of the IDEA method could be used in other agro-ecological zones in Benin and Africa. © The Author(s) 2017.},

The land use categories Business Commercial, Industrial, Agricultural holdings and Sports & Parks displayed similar median AADDs of between 1.5 and 1.7 kl/property/day. Educational properties used substantially more water (4.7 kl/property/day), while Government & Institutional properties used substantially less water (0.7 kl/property/day). A step-wise regression analyses showed that property size has the greatest impact on water demand for most categories.

abstract={Private forest owners' involvement in forest management has been frequently examined through the attitudes, values, beliefs, objectives and motivations associated with owning and managing forestland. Owners' views on forest management do not always align with those of policymakers who believe forest owners do not actively manage their forests. However, empirical studies on forest owners' conceptualisations of forest management are scarce. To determine how private forest owners in Europe conceptualise forest management, a survey (n = 1140) was undertaken in seven European countries (Portugal, France, the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Slovakia and Romania). The owners were asked to indicate their level of agreement with 19 pre-tested statements defining forest management on a five-point Likert scale. Classification and regression trees were used to explain the major factors that influenced owners' conceptualisations. Owners primarily conceptualised forest management as preserving forests for future generations and considered “a good business opportunity”, “an opportunity to earn additional money” or a “source of subsidies” less important. Their understanding of forest management as a mixture of forest maintenance, ecosystem stewardship and economic activity does not match with alleged policy makers’ views. Property size, age and Eastern/Western countries were the most relevant predictors of definitions of forest management. Small-scale forest owners from Western Europe considered ecosystem orientation more important, while owners from Eastern Europe considered economic aspects and forest maintenance more important. These differences might be associated with the socio-political system dynamics in Europe in the 20th century and changing values in post-modern society. Policymakers must be aware of the different forest management paradigms among forest owners in Eastern-Central and Western Europe when designing European forest policies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The problem of sensor placement for early-warning detection systems is a topical issue for industry and utilities who want to equip their networks with such technology. Solving the problem entails finding the best sensor locations that optimize a criterion such as detection rate or time to detection. Few methods exist concerning sensor placement that optimize the result of a source identification method. This paper fills the gap by coupling an adjoint source identification method and a Monte Carlo sensor placement algorithm. The first one is treated through the use of a backtracking algorithm. It uses binary responses at sensors to calculate the ranked list of potential contamination location nodes and contamination times. A criterion is then defined based on the source identification accuracy and specificity. Finally, two optimizing methods that maximize this criterion are proposed: a greedy algorithm and a local search algorithm, which are both coupled with a Monte Carlo method to give the locations of sensors that are the best suited for allocating the source of a contamination. These methods are tested on a 2,500-node network to evaluate their efficiency. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={Until the 1990s, the European water policy has been defined by and for water users abstracting water or discharging waste through water infrastructures: urban water services, irrigated agriculture and industries discharging pollutants into rivers. The European Water Framework directive (WFD) issued in 2000 departs from this sectorial stance. It regulates all continental aquatic systems in order to take into account cumulative effects of environmental degradations. This article evaluates the ecologisation of the European water policy through its instruments of regulation and governance. It presents a typology of policy learning in relation to their sector-based or ecological orientation in a multilevel context. At European level, the enactment of the WFD may be explained by mere strategic learning. Its implementation at French level requires further elaboration and implies: (1) sector-based strategic learning fostering equipment; (2) ecological conceptual learning; and (3) uncertainties generated by new commensuration process. In this case, ecological mainstreaming proceeds along two avenues: recycling of previously marginal ecological tools designed within the water sector and ignorance of new tools and other actors strategies. © L'Harmattan.

This adaptation is important not only to reduce the cost of future damage but also to maintain the beaches which are an attractive feature for tourism, of vital importance for coastal areas. Some 421 residents with main and secondary homes were surveyed in Hyères-les-palmiers in the Var department (Southeast France). The survey sought to compare the willingness of residents to contribute financially to building a seawall or to relocating sea-front property. Preferences depend both on common variables and variables specific to the proposed arrangement. They reveal common concerns focused on effectiveness and the determining factor of property ownership. The results also show some awareness of the long-term advantages of managed retreat, despite some opposition from older people, who are also more sceptical about the reality of the risk incurred. © 2017},

abstract={Sea-level rise due to climate change will have significant effects on coastal areas and populations. Adaptation policies recommend the managed realignment of the most vulnerable assets and activities. Despite their medium- and long-term benefits, these policies face significant friction due to social acceptability in the communities where they are implemented. This article investigates the hypothesis that respecting principles of justice in the implementation of managed realignment should increase its acceptability. We compare preferences of those people who are exposed to the risk of climate-change-induced flooding and those who are not, as regards funding managed retreat policies and defining compensation criteria for assets at risk. The main theories of social justice provide the four principles included in the analysis: efficiency, need, responsibility and priority assigned to property rights. A choice experiment survey was conducted with 258 residents of coastal and hinterland communities in the south of France. Four attributes were selected to define the managed realignment policy: the dialogue arrangements, the implementation period, the policy implementation schedule and the cost. The results show support for a relatively fast launch of these policies (within 15 years) but in stages and through a process of dialogue with the population. People's perceptions of the funding criteria reveal a preference for national solidarity. Finally, national funding of managed retreat policies and compensation criteria based on market prices have a significant positive influence on the acceptability of managed realignment policies, whereas introducing responsibility-based compensation criteria tends to favour the status quo over the adaptation policy. Policy relevance Prioritization of the funding criteria reveals the preference for national solidarity. Preferences for the justice criteria underpinning compensation reveal a great diversity of values. Besides implantation modalities, preferences for managed realignment policies depend on which level they are implemented at, on the expropriation criteria (the emphasis given to property rights, i.e. market price), on the attachment (people perceived as worst off, i.e. the property is their main residence rather than a second home or they have lower levels of income) and on the degree of responsibility (related to the date of purchase, i.e. on the information given at the time on the risk). © 2016 Taylor & Francis.},

For this we used an analytical framework inspired by Science and Technology Studies.

These same firms took advantage of the two major storms which occurred in 1999 and 2009.

abstract={Climate change is increasingly accepted as a major worldwide issue, bringing with it a host of long-term consequences for both human beings and ecosystems. To more effectively limit the damage caused by natural hazards and global change, it is essential that we gain a greater understanding of the complex question of social vulnerability—a subject that has been widely discussed in the literature. This paper examines the use of a conceptual “human wellbeing” framework to analyse vulnerability. It also proposes an innovative statistical method (ClustOfVar) to capture the multidimensional nature of that vulnerability. Using our approach, it is possible to construct composite indicators of residents’ living conditions at municipality level. To test our methodology, we carried out a comprehensive evaluation of the development of residents’ quality of life for two specific years (1999 and 2009) in areas close to the Garonne and Gironde rivers in southwest France. The results reveal different municipality trajectories in terms of quality of life profiles. This study helps to understand the multivariate characteristics of communities with higher social vulnerability. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. This paper contributes to the understanding of the interface between risk perception and climate change risk mitigation in coastal areas. In particular, we analyse the role of science-based knowledge and the so called "knowledge gap" in coastal stakeholders' verbalized perceptions of coastal risk. We use a qualitative approach to analyse of a corpus of 29 interviews conducted in three coastal European settings: Santander Bay (Spain), the Gironde Estuary (France), and Cesenatico (Italy). This analysis of stakeholders' perceptions of flood risk shows: (i) the science-based understanding of flooding as a probabilistic process is not always present and has little impact on the stated perceptions; and (ii) stakeholders and society as a whole frame risk mostly through values and norms. Given these findings, an increase in science-based knowledge within the world of coastal risk governance under climate change would contribute to safer coasts, provided that the production of science-based knowledge takes into account stakeholder values through a proactive dialogue with stakeholders. © Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2017.},

abstract={Non-point source pollution is a cause of major concern within the European Union. This is reflected in increasing public and political focus on a more sustainable use of pesticides, as well as a reduction in diffuse pollution. Climate change will likely to lead to an even more intensive use of pesticides in the future, affecting agriculture in many ways. At the same time, the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and associated EU policies called for a “good” ecological and chemical status to be achieved for water bodies by the end of 2015, currently delayed to 2021–2027 due to a lack of efficiency in policies and timescale of resilience for hydrosystems, especially groundwater systems. Water managers need appropriate and user-friendly tools to design agro-environmental policies. These tools should help them to evaluate the potential impacts of mitigation measures on water resources, more clearly define protected areas, and more efficiently distribute financial incentives to farmers who agree to implement alternative practices. At present, a number of reports point out that water managers do not use appropriate information from monitoring or models to make decisions and set environmental action plans. In this paper, we propose an integrated and collaborative approach to analyzing changes in land use, farming systems, and practices and to assess their effects on agricultural pressure and pesticide transfers to waters. The integrated modeling of agricultural scenario (IMAS) framework draws on a range of data and expert knowledge available within areas where a pesticide action plan can be defined to restore the water quality, French “Grenelle law” catchment areas, French Water Development and Management Plan areas, etc. A so-called “reference scenario” represents the actual soil occupation and pesticide-spraying practices used in both conventional and organic farming. A number of alternative scenarios are then defined in cooperation with stakeholders, including socio-economic conditions for developing alternative agricultural systems or targeting mitigation measures. Our integrated assessment of these scenarios combines the calculation of spatialized environmental indicators with integrated bio-economic modeling. The latter is achieved by a combined use of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) modeling with our own purpose-built land use generator module (Generator of Land Use version 2 (GenLU2)) and an economic model developed using General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) for cost-effectiveness assessment. This integrated approach is applied to two embedded catchment areas (total area of 360,000 ha) within the Charente river basin (SW France). Our results show that it is possible to differentiate scenarios based on their effectiveness, represented by either evolution of pressure (agro-environmental indicators) or transport into waters (pesticide concentrations). By analyzing the implementation costs borne by farmers, it is possible to identify the most cost-effective scenarios at sub-basin and other aggregated levels (WFD hydrological entities, sensitive areas). Relevant results and indicators are fed into a specifically designed database. Data warehousing is used to provide analyses and outputs at all thematic, temporal, or spatial aggregated levels, defined by the stakeholders (type of crops, herbicides, WFD areas, years), using Spatial On-Line Analytical Processing (SOLAP) tools. The aim of this approach is to allow public policy makers to make more informed and reasoned decisions when managing sensitive areas and/or implementing mitigation measures. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The first-order sensitivity matrices (matrices of sensitivity or influence coefficients) have application in many areas of water distribution system analysis. Finite-difference approximations, automatic differentiation, sensitivity equations, and the adjoint method have been used in the past to estimate sensitivity. In this paper new, explicit formulas for the first-order sensitivities of water distribution system (WDS) steady-state heads and flows to changes in demands, resistance factors, roughnesses, relative roughnesses, and diameters are presented. The formulas cover both pressure-dependent modeling (PDM) and demand-dependent modeling (DDM) problems in which either the Hazen-Williams or the Darcy-Weisbach head-loss models are used. Two important applications of sensitivity matrices, namely calibration and sensor placement, are discussed and illustrative examples of the use of sensitivity matrices in those applications are given. The use of sensitivity matrices in first-order confidence estimation is briefly discussed. The superior stability of the PDM formulation over DDM is established by the examination of the sensitivity matrices for the same network solved by both model paradigms. The sensitivity matrices and the key matrices in both the global gradient method for DDM problems and its counterpart for PDM problems have many elements in common. This means that the sensitivity matrices can be computed at marginal cost during the solution process with either of these methods. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={This article reflects on the idea of being ‘green’ along with the increased closeness to nature which this implies. Starting with the practice of leisure activities in protected natural sites, or those in the process of becoming so, in France and Canada, the authors try to decipher the often ambiguous relationship with nature. The nature wished for is not natural and natural nature is not wished for. The research study found that, while those who practice leisure activities claimed to be seeking fusion with the wilderness, their search for what is aesthetically pleasing and their need for access led them back to a ‘managed’ nature. That is to say, a nature managed by people who, at the same time, control access, and which is all the more legitimate in these territories since environmental issues have been defined which rarely take social construction into account. Behind the ideal of ‘the wild,’ being green, rather, participates in domesticating the uses of nature, thereby contributing to a new form of social control. © 2017 Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières.},

We have addressed these issues in the context of their interaction with urban policies. This article analyses the interactions between the Calanques National Park and the city of Marseille through the analytical framework of environmental effort. Environmental effort can be defined as the socially differentiated and potentially unequal contribution of social actors to public environmental protection policies. First, we show how the territorial make-up of Marseille has always involved a great deal of crossover between the city, the countryside and nature. Second, we examine the boundaries between the city and nature today, a result of convergence between a prevailing naturalist vision that dominated the creation of the Calanques National Park and the city’s urbanism strategy. Third, we show how the environmental effort required of the population in some districts to protect the Calanques in the context of park policy is compounded by an additional urban environmental effort required of inhabitants to support the transformations imposed on their immediate environment. © 2017, Articulo - Journal of Urban Research.

abstract={The term bioeconomy has been generated as a new discourse in the environmental policy arena. This paper raises three questions: (i) are environmental concerns integrated in the political discourses of bioeconomy and, if so, to what extent?, (ii) in which way is the environment framed in the political discourses of bioeconomy?, and (iii) are environmental concerns considered in the political discourses on forest-based bioeconomy? The theoretical framework of this paper builds on the cognitive approach of policy integration and on frame analysis. The empirical research design is a comparative qualitative analysis of five different political bioeconomy discourses in the EU and four different EU member states - Germany, Finland, France and the Netherlands - in general and in the forestry sector specifically. Results show a weak and mainly rhetorical integration of environmental concerns in political bioeconomy discourses. Three major environmental frames are identified: (i) The dominant frame of 'Environment benefitting from economic growth', (ii) the 'Environment as a challenge' and (iii) the less visible 'Environment as a standard' frame. In general, these frames address the environment mainly as a challenge or something that needs to be safeguarded with the help of the bioeconomy. With the exception of Finland, amongst the countries studied, forests plays only a minor role in bioeconomy discourses while environmental concerns in this strand of discussion are mainly focused on sustainability arguments in general. © 2017 BioOne.

It explores the preferences of residents in the Eurométropole de Strasbourg (France), with the aim of redefining priorities for sewer network asset management. Valuation is performed using the contingent ranking method and results are compared to a recoded choice experiment. Comparison of results from both methods reveals that price influences the ranking of the different alternatives given to the respondents, but does not influence respondents’ preferred alternative. In other words, the price of the alternatives is only considered by respondents later in the decision process. For residents, the trade-offs between the potential disruption caused by a network malfunction favour the reduction of the risk of flooding (either in terms of their frequency or attained water levels). These findings highlight the challenges of asset management. Copyright © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={This paper presents a novel data analysis methodology for determining the approximate location of a leak/burst within a District Metered Area (DMA). This methodology is based on Statistical Process Control (SPC) and it is encapsulated in a Leakage Location System (LLS) that automatically processes the night-time data recorded, with a one minute frequency, by the DMA's pressure loggers. The LLS was field tested and verified on a large number of real-life DMAs with both real and engineered leak/burst events (i.e., simulated by opening fire hydrants). The selected DMAs have varying sizes and different characteristics (e.g., industrial/urban/rural, pressure-managed/gravity-fed, etc.). These DMAs were monitored for a period of approximately 4 months and 132 engineered events simulating leaks/bursts ranging between 1% and 40% of the average DMAs' inflow were carried out. The results obtained illustrate that the LLS enables obtaining substantially reduced operational costs by significantly reducing the leaks/bursts search area and reducing the number of unnecessary leak/burst repairs. The results obtained also illustrate that the LLS has the potential to enable water companies to: (a) improve customer service through more proactive and informed communications and reduction of the number/duration of supply interruptions and poor pressure situations, (b) realise a wide range of sustainability and environmental type benefits by saving large amounts of water, reducing energy requirements for pumping, consumption of chemicals for water treatment and hence the carbon footprint and (c) reduce the social costs associated with the disruption of traffic and business, the reduced fire-fighting capabilities and the potential of pollutant ingress through cracks. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={Modeling of water distribution systems is fundamental for the design, analysis and operation of any water network. As with all hydraulic models, water demands are one of the most important input components in the model. However, estimation of the demand parameters is usually complicated due to the stochastic behavior of the water consumptions. Several methods have been proposed for estimating water demands. Most of them have been developed based on given frameworks where the number of unknown parameters is assumed to be equal or less than the number of measurements. The outcomes, therefore, rely on this assumption, which can lead to significant approximation errors in real water distribution systems. The approach proposed in this paper does not require the number of known inputs to be equal to the number of variables. In fact, nodes in the model could each have a different demand pattern. The genetic algorithm approach adopted here shows that the average results of multiple GA runs can estimate the demand patterns at each node. Moreover, the model can also be used to estimate the flow rates and nodal heads at non-measured locations of the water network, although the accuracy of the estimation depends on number, type and location of the measurements. Results are shown and discussed for a literature case study tested for a 24-hour time period. © 2017 The Authors.},

abstract={This paper examines the creation of local renewable energy initiatives, using the example of wood biomass in the Aquitaine area of Southwest France. Our approach uses theoretical tools taken from the specific resources approach, as well as proximity economics. We show how several cases of wood biomass projects in Aquitaine rely on the creation of specific resources which are provided through various forms of proximity. Such examples cover a variety of places and energy uses. We identify possible contradictions between the objectives supported by territorial development on the one hand and energy transition on the other hand. © 2017 Lavoisier, Paris.

abstract={We explore the connections between the concepts of governance and sustainability and discuss their possible roles in water and sanitation management systems (WSMS). We see governance as a decision-making process that drives the relationship between social institutions and the public affairs of a given society. We understand sustainability as a combination of spatial, temporal, and personal aspects, and we argue that this definition is more comprehensive than the traditional triple bottom line of economy, environment, and society. We combined these two concepts into a new conceptual framework of "governance for sustainability" that is theoretically sound and arguably appropriate to understand local WSMS. To illustrate this framework, we developed and estimated a Sustainable Water Governance Index (SWGI) for the city of Salta, Argentina. This aggregated index was calculated with data from literature, information from the city's water company and other local institutions, field visits, and interviews. The SWGI for Salta obtained an overall score of 49 on a 0-100 scale, which fell into the "danger" range. We discuss the advantages and limitations of the method and conclude that aggregated indices such as the SWGI, complemented with contextual information, can be a helpful decision-making tool to promote more sustainable WSMS. © 2012 by the authors.},
